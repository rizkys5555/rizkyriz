Problem & Objective
========================================================
- **Problem**: Typing on mobile devices is often slow and prone to errors (typos).
- **Objective**: To build a fast and accurate word prediction algorithm to enhance the user's typing experience.
- **Solution**: A Shiny application that predicts the next word in real-time based on the user's text input.

The Prediction Algorithm
========================================================
This algorithm is built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques:
- **N-grams**: Utilizes Bigram, Trigram, and Quadgram databases sourced from news, blogs, and Twitter corpora.
- **Simple Back-off**: If a 4-word phrase is not found, the algorithm "backs off" to search in 3-word, then 2-word tables until the best match is found.
- **Efficiency**: Data has been cleaned (including profanity filtering) and pruned to ensure a lightweight and fast application performance.

The Shiny Application
========================================================
The app is designed with a strong focus on user experience:
- **Real-time Prediction**: The next word appears automatically as you type.
- **Clean Interface**: A minimalist design that ensures easy navigation.
- **Versatility**: Capable of handling various sentence contexts thanks to a comprehensive dataset.

How to Use the App
========================================================
1. Access the application via the provided Shinyapps.io link.
2. Type a word or phrase into the input field located in the left sidebar.
3. The predicted result will immediately appear on the main panel on the right.
4. Continue typing to see how the prediction dynamically changes based on your sentence context.

Why It Matters
========================================================
- **Time Saving**: Significantly reduces the number of keystrokes required.
- **Accuracy**: Assists users in choosing the right word within the correct context.
- **Future Potential**: This algorithm can be further developed for personalized user-specific language adaptations.
